To be able to display/print Atari text output in ATASCII you need to install ATASCII fonts (by Mark Simonson).

 In Windows platform, you need to right-click on each font file and click install.This should install the font on Windows fonts folder (i.e C:\Windows\fonts). If right click/install is not supported by the version of Windows you are using, simply copy the font files to the fonts folder.

There are 3 different font files you can choose from and you can verify successul installation fonts with Notepad. Simply open a text file and choose Font from Notepad menu and scroll through available fonts. You should see 3 fonts with names starting with the word Atari.

That's it, for more details and some limitations of these fonts see the Atascii_fonts.zip file in the binary distribution archive.
