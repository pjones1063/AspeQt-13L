release 2
        * merged OSX fixes from DrVenkman (LameLefty on github). These fixes
        improve CPU usage and serial performance on OSX. Thanks to DrVenkman
        for implementing and testing them, and also thanks to Hias for pointing
        out where and what the changes should be.

        to Hias for pointing it out and suggesting the fix.
        * fixed Help -> About AspeQt and Help -> User Manual, thanks to Kyle22
        for pointing out that they were outdated. They should automatically
        mirror changes in about.html and the user manual as well.
        * updated documentation to match the current state of things. (thanks
        to Kyle22 again, for pointing out that I had forgotten to do this when
        I released r1).
        - translations are *probably* totally broken at this point, until new
        ones are created specifically for AspeQt, and a couple other things
        are fixed (like handling of multiple languages in the user manual
        dialog)
        * cleaned up source tree a bit
        * added temporary fix for incorrect Operation Complete and Operation
        Error timing (fixes #2)

release 1
        * added ApeTime support back in
        * updated 2 references to AspeQt, 1 reference to Ray Ataergin, and 1
        reference to Ray's website in readme.txt. Thanks to Kyle22 for pointing
        this out.

Forked to AspeQt - June 29, 2015 - release 0
	* added workaround for a bug on some linux releases related to the QT
	appmenu stuff which would cause the menu bar to not appear.
	* changed some code in mainwindow.cpp:130 so that AspeQt doesn't
	conflict with AspeQT. Also imports settings from AspeQt, if AspeQt
	doesn't already have it's own settings.
	* de-Rayed AspeQt source for forking to AspeQt. That is, changed
	(hopefully) all references to Ray Ataergin to Joseph Zatarski where
	it makes sense, and changed all references from AspeQt to AspeQt. If
	you find somewhere I have faild to do one of these things, let me know.
	You will get a mention somewhere, probably on the about page.
	- probably broke translations somewhat, but maybe not
	- german manual from AspeQt needs a rewrite for AspeQt	

version 1.0.0 Preview-7 (Nov 29, 2014) (Ray Ataergin)
     * Changed Image Explorer so that it sorts files ignoring file name cases, this makes it compatible with Windows Explorer and
       provides a more consistent look between the two.
     * Fixed an error causing files read by SpartaDOS X from a Folder Image, with a size greater than 73875 bytes (72KB), to enter
       an endless read loop. Large files with no size limit can now be read/copied. 
     * In the original implementation of Folder Images, Image Explorer Window used 999 sectors as the allowed maximum for a file
       (a la Atari DOS 2.5), so the maximum file size for a file was displayed as 124875 bytes. This caused the dragging and dropping of
       those larger files to fail because dropped file had a wrong size. This fix lifts the maximum 999 sectors limit and allows the file
       to be up to 65535 sectors thus bringing the maximum file size that can be manipulated with Image Explorer to 8,191,875 bytes (8MB).
       This also fixes issues with SDX Copy command progress display which now correctly displays the percentage completed.

version 1.0.0 Preview-6 (May 23, 2014) (Ray Ataergin)
    * Windows registry entries for AspeQt are now stored under "atari8warez.com" registry tree,
      the program will automatically migrate settings on the next run.
      Existing AspeQt session files storing session settings are not affected by this change
    + Code needed to compile AspeQt under Mac OS X is added (David Voswinkel - optixx)
        (see compile.rtf file included with the source archive)
    * Folder images are now emulated in DOS 2.5 disk format rather than DOS 2.0
      This gives more unique sector numbers to work with before they are re-used in a circular fashion.
    * Fixed the "Not a binary file" error loading certain executable files.
    * Text conversion is now OS platform aware (Win, Linux, OS X)
    * Explorer Window Stay-on-top feature is now user selectable and persistent across sessions


version 1.0.0 Preview-5 (Feb 23, 2014)(Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed a bug in Image Explorer where text translations were done when it wasn't required, which
      caused binary files to become corrupted in some cases.
    * Fixed a problem with data size checking in Text conversion mode. The check ignored the fact that
      opening a file in text conversion mode will convert carriage return/line feed characters and rejected the file displaying
      an "Unknown error" because number of bytes read from the file did not match the expected data size, changed the message text
      to display a more meaningful explanation.

version 1.0.0 Preview-4 (Feb 20, 2014) (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added code to make explorer window to stay on top of all other windows.
    + Added a reload button to the "Boot Atari Executable" dialog. The button re-loads the selected executable file before the
      Atari is re-booted. Useful for Atari developers who use this dialog for continuous testing. The button allows automatic
      refresh of AspeQt buffers by reloading the file without having to close the dialog when the executable has changed between Atari reboots.
    - Simplified the "Boot Atari Executable" dialog by removing the "Keep this dialog open" check box. The dialog will now remain open until it
      is exclusively closed by the Cancel and Close buttons. This update also fixes the issue of opening multiple instances of the said dialog.

version 1.0.0 Preview-3 (Feb 11, 2014) (Ray Ataergin)
    * GUI changes for more screen space savings as follows:
        - Smaller buttons
        - Shorter drive designators
        - Log area is shrunk to single line height, double-click on the line to open a full view
          log window, if the main window is resized, the log area can be expanded by clicking and dragging the single line.
    + Added larger font support to the disk slot descriptions. New font size can be made permanent in the User Interface Options.
    * Shade mode is now optional through a setting in the User Interface Options.


version 1.0.0 Preview-2 (Feb 07, 2014)
    + Added a single slot view called Mini/Shade Mode, in this mode only one disk slot is shown and minimal screen
      real estate is used. This is for users who run AspeQt mainly from a single folder or ATR. Can be activated/toggled
      through the new Window menu item or with CTRL+SHIFT+M keysequence.
      The window can be tacked away in a corner of the screen in a semi transparent mode called Shade Mode.
      When the cursor is moved over the window it becomes fully opaque for easier viewing and returns back to
      semi transparent mode once the mouse cursor leaves. All menu features are still available in this mode. (Ray Ataergin)
    + AspeQt log can now be displayed on a seperate window independent from the main window. A filter option
      is added to filter log items by disk id. A menu item is also added to invoke log view window
      in mini mode as the regular log area is not shown to save screen space. In full view mode the same window
      can also be invoked by double-clicking on the log area. (Ray Ataergin)
    + Re-organized menu item shortcut keys (Ray Ataergin)

version 1.0.0 Preview-1 (Jan 25, 2014)
    * Changed/fixed various UI elements (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added an option to Start/Stop Printer Emulation (Ray Ataergin)
        Turning the emulation OFF will allow the user to use an Atari connected printer instead of a PC printer.
        This switch affects the currently running session of AspeQt only and is not permanent between sessions.
    + Added an option to hide/show drives 9-15. (Ray Ataergin)
        This switch is either permanent or temporary depending on user preference, and can be:
        - temporary for the currently running session or,
        - globally permanent (for all sessions of AspeQt running on the same computer) or,
        - permenant for select sessions of AspeQt (when AspeQt is run from a session file)
    - Removed the half-baked ATX file support code in favour of using VAPI.DLL, as the author who started the work on ATX support
      is no longer interested in developing it further. VAPI.DLL support will be added before V1.0 final release (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.8.8 (Mar 10, 2013)
    + Added an option (Options/Emulation menu) to selectively enable/disable filtering of underscore character from file names in Folder Images (Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed a problem where "Unmount All" menu item was only unmounting the first 8 images. (Marcin Sochacki)
    * Updated Polish language translations (Marcin Sochacki - TheMontezuma)
    + Added Spanish translation (Abel Carrasco - AsCrNet)

version 0.8.7 (Jan 28, 2013)
    * Updated Turkish translations (Ray Ataergin)
    * Updated the AspeQt documentation (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added Folder Image boot support for MyDos, MyPicoDos and SpartaDos.
      AspeQt now offers an option to switch between those 4 different DOSes
      automatically. The user no longer needs to supply the required DOS files
      or the file containing the boot sectors ($boot.bin) as AspeQt includes
      them and switches from one DOS to another through the UI. The context menu
      (right clicking on a mounted folder image on D1:) will present a window with
      DOS selections. By choosing a DOS and clicking Apply on that window
      will switch DOSes and the next reboot of the Atari will boot selected DOS
      from the Folder Image. For details of the switching mechanism, the limitations
      of, and more, please see AspeQt documentation. (Ray Ataergin)
    * Changed the color and boldness of the Folder Image names to visually
      differentiate them from other file images. (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.8.6 (Jan 15, 2013)
    * Updated the English language manual. (Ray Ataergin)
    + Minor re-grouping of drive slot buttons. (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added directory print capability to image explorer window (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added boot capability from a Folder Image. Simply copy the DOS.SYS and DUP.SYS files from
      a DOS diskette to a PC Folder, mount the PC folder to drive slot#:1 as a Folder Image
      and boot your Atari. Currently only Atari DOS has a built-in support. MyDos will be
      supported on the next release. (Ray Ataergin)
        (For the time being if you need MyDOS support instead of Atari DOS, just replace the
        DOS.SYS and DUP.SYS files in the PC Folder with the corresponding ones from a MyDOS
        disk, you also need to supply a boot image file ($boot.bin) which contains the boot
        sectors (1-3) from a MyDOS disk (384 bytes) and replace the existing $boot.bin file
        in the application's directory (PC folder where AspeQt is installed). (Ray Ataergin)
    - Dropped ApeTime support from AspeQt. AspeCL is now the only supported Time/Date client (Ray Ataergin)
      + Remote Control software for AspeQt (see AspeQt documentation for more info) (Ray Ataergin)
    + Implemented auto-commit remote toggle capability to AspeCL, it was previously documented
      as "in development feature" (Ray Ataergin)
    + Implemented remote image file creating/mounting capability to AspeCL, it was previously documented
      as "in development feature" (Ray Ataergin)
    + Implemented remote image file mounting capability to AspeCL, it was previously documented
      as "in development feature" (Ray Ataergin)
    * Tested and fixed AspeCL client SpartaDos X date/time handling (this was not previously tested as I did not have
      SDX back then) (Ray Ataergin)
    * Updated AspeCL client code to accomodate SDX drives 9-15 (Ray Ataergin)
    * Updated AspeCL server code in AspeQt to accomodate SDX drives 9-15 (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.8.5
    * Updated the AspeQt English language user manual (Ray Ataergin)
    + New tooltips are added to display extend info on mounted image properties.
    + Increased the supported drive numbers from 8 to 15 for SDX compatibility (Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed SDX incompatibility of Folder Images (Ray Ataergin - Many thanks to Drac0/Phearon
      for their contributions in solving the SDX cache problem)
    + Added browsing capability for Folder Images. This release only allows read-only support with
      drag & drop file copying from the Folder Image. Multiple Folder Images can be mounted (Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed a bug where AspeQt opened the "application folder" instead of the "Last Image Folder"
      if the user wanted to mount a diskimage on a disk that already had an image mounted. (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added German translation (Florian Dingler)

version 0.8.4
    + Added Slovak translation (Victor Cech).
    * Fixed a path separator issue with Linux/Mac OS (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.8.3
    + Added option to keep the Boot Executable dialog open for succesive reboots of the same file (Ray Ataergin)
    * Updated Turkish language translation (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added a non-verbose version of AspeCl called AspeClQ (Q for quiet). AspeClQ does away with all help, status and error messages
      reducing the exe file size considerably. This is the version to use if memory is scarse or in a batch file without disturbing
      the current screen content. (Ray Ataergin)
    * Added new command line switches to AspeCl and the code to support it in AspeQt (Ray Ataergin)
        More than one switch can be specified on the command line and switches must be separated by at least one blank space.


        DA[ds]   => Toggle auto-save OFF (s=0) or ON (s=1), on a given disk image (d). Toggling auto-save switch to ON will commit all
                    pending changes to the affected disk image. Can be used to make sure all changes are committed before unmounting a
                    disk image remotely. If the toggle is set ON on a newly created and mounted disk image, operator intervention will
                    be required from the server (AspeQt) side to assign a file name to the image file before it's saved to PC hard disk.
                    (Currently in development)

        DS[dd]   =>  Swap disks, where dd are the drive numbers to be swapped (i.e DS15 will swap disks 1 and 5).
                     Implemented in version 0.8.3

        DU[d/*]  =>  Unmount disk(s). Will either unmount a single disk [d], or all disks [*]
                     Unmount will not unmount disks that have changes until the changes are commited.
                     Disks set to "auto-commit" in AspeQt will be unmounted immediately as the changes to these images are commited automatically.
                     Implemented in version 0.8.3

        DM[fname.[ext]]  => Mount an existing disk image,
                            Will mount a supported disk image file from the last disk image directory used by AspeQt.
                            The new image will be mounted to the first available disk slot (Currently in development)

        DN[fname.{ext].[1/2/3/4/5]] => Create and mount a new disk image. Will create a new disk image, assign a name to it, and mount it.
                                       The disk image will be created in the last image directory used by AspeQt (Currently in development)

                                         1 - Standard Single Density
                                         2 - Standard Enhanced density
                                         3 - Standard Double Density
                                         4 - Double sided, double density
                                         5 - Double density Harddisk

                   Example: DNmyhd.atr.5, will create a double density harddisk .atr image with the name myhd

        An example of invoking AspeCl with multiple command line switches:

        ASPECL TF DS18 DMbasicxe.atr  => Will set the date/time and turn TD line OFF, will swap disks 1-8, will mount basicxe.atr to
        the first available disk slot, returning back the slot number to Atari. SEE ASPEQT USER MANUAL FOR COMPLETE ASPECL documentation.

    * Fixed a problem with AspeQt dropping from READY state when 1st opened. The bug was introduced by session enhancement in v8.0.2 (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added a 250ms delay to allow for COM port successfuly closing before it's re-opened when a session file is loaded.
      Without the delay AspeQt sometimes fails to re-connect to the COM port with a "Access Denied" error. (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.8.2
    + Added multi-session capability. This allows the AspeQt user to invoke multiple
      instances of AspeQt and use a different configurations for each session.
      Session files were already partly implemented in AspeQt to save/restore mounted disk image groups.
      This modification takes it further by adding other configuration settings unique to the session.
      AspeQt normally saves all it's settings to Windows Registry, and restores them from there
      when it's first launched. With this mod, AspeQt will first examine it's command line to see
      if a session file was specified, and if it was, then AspeQt will load it's session specific
      configuration parameters from the given session file. If no session file name was found, then
      AspeQt will load all of it's settings from Windows Registry as usual.
      See AspeQt documentation for session specific settings. (Ray Ataergin)
    * Updated some icons for consistency accross main window menu items (Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed a problem with missing icon in About Dialog (Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed a problem with Text Printer Window menu item icon not displaying properly (Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed a problem with "last session directory" registry entry (Ray Ataergin)
    * Changed code to make sure all path separators are cross platform compatible (forward slash) in registry
      and session files (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.8.1
    + Added preliminary .ATX image support (does not seem to be fully functional) (Krzysztof Pyrkosz)
    * Updated Polish translation (Krzysztof Pyrkosz)
    * Updated Turkish translation (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added Russian translation (Nikita Zimin)
    * Updated high speed exe loader (Matthias Reichl)
    + Added auto-commit (auto-save) function for disk images.
      Changes made to disk images can now be saved automatically without user intervention (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.8
    + This version introduces the AspeQt client module AspeCl. AspeCl runs on the Atari computer and serves as a client
      to AspeQt. In this release only Date/Time functionality is implemented, in future releases more
      functionality will be added. (Ray Ataergin)

            AspeCl is fully compatible with SpartaDos and SDX, and support the following command line switches:

                    TS  => Set Date/Time on Atari
                    TO  => Set Date/Time on Atari and turn TD Line ON
                    TF  => Set Date/Time on Atari and turn TD Line OFF

                         usage:  AspeCl TS|TO|TF

      With the introduction of AspeCl the use of Apetime is now deprecated. AspeQt still supports Apetime as is
      with no further development to adapt to future releases of Apetime (Ray Ataergin)
    + MainWindow SIZE is now saved and restored (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added a "Strip Line Numbers" option when saving text printer output to a PC file.
      This will help ease the conversion of Atari based source programs printed through AspeQT for editing/compiling on a PC based IDE/Compiler (Ray Ataergin)
    * Reorganized About Dialog content (Ray Ataergin)
    + MainWindow POSITION is now saved and restored (Ray Ataergin)
    + Created and added an application icon, modified main window to use the new icon (Ray Ataergin).
    * Fixed a keyboard shortcut conflict with Windows on text printer output window and reassigned keyboard shortcuts (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.7
    + Disk slots now show the filename without the path.
        The directory path can be seen as a tooltip to filename, and the full path+filename can be seen as a
        statusTip on the status bar. This makes it much easier to read the mounted file/folder names. (Ray Ataergin)
    * Decrease the latency on Win32 systems  (Matthias Reichl).
    * Remove the retry limit when waiting for a command frame  (Matthias Reichl).
    + Modified Atari text output to display Ascii/Atascii split screen window (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added ATASCII font support for Atari text output (Ray Ataergin)
    * Fixed problems with Pokey divisors 0 and 1 on PAL 800XL. Set the baudrates to values actually
      supported by the FTDI chip to avoid possible rounding errors - resulting in too high speeds - (Matthias Reichl)
    * Fixed small backslash-escape issue in the project file (Matthias Reichl)
    * A (cosmetic) fix for the image size calculation in the "create image" dialog (Matthias Reichl)
    + Added support for ATRs with 8192 byte sectors (Matthias Reichl)
    + Added Turkish translation (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added option to send the Atari text output to a PC printer (Ray Ataergin)
    + Added option to display documentation (Ray Ataergin)
    + Relaxed the .atr integrity check rules to allow some .atr files that are larger than the
      header value to load (Ray Ataergin)

version 0.6
    + Added language selector and language selection based on system locale
    + Added polish translation by Krzysztof Pyrkosz
    * Many small fixes and improvements

version 0.5.1
    + Cassette image support
    * Some cosmetic fixes in the log display

version 0.5
    + Higher speeds than x3 (57600) can be achieved if the serial port adaptor supports them
    + New EXE booter with optional high speed SIO routines
    + Drag drop support for files with EXE, COM and XEX extensions
    + Preliminary printer emulation
    + Text conversion for image explorer is now working properly under Windows
    + Old temporary files resulting from crashes are now removed when AspeQt starts
    * Fixed some race conditions that could cause problems with multiple cores/CPUs

version 0.4
    * Fixed an image explorer bug that caused crashes
    + Added read-only SpartaDos support for image explorer

version 0.3
    + Image explorer for AtariDos / MyDos files
    + Support for 512 bytes/sector ATR images
    * Disk images are now opened using a temporary file
    - Compressed and raw disk image support is temporarily removed
    * Slightly improved folder images
    * Many GUI changes
    * Broken disk images are now rejected

version 0.2
    + Support for AtariSIO
    * Windows serial I/O backend is entirely rewritten

version 0.1
    + First public release
